## Hi there 👋
I'm Pine, a rising senior majoring in CS and Linguistics from Pomona College! I love learning languages and listening to music. I hope to work with Natural Language Processing projects, make cool apps with Spotify, and create software that facilitates language learning!

## Projects and Background 🎯
🔭 I’m currently working on ...
* A Spotify social media app
* JogJams, a spotify running playlist generator (from songs you know!)

🌱 I’m currently learning React, Express, PHP, NLP

⚡ Fun fact: My name Pine is from an [email reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_(email_client))!

💬 Ask me about my daily water intake 🤔💦
